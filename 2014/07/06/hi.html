<p>Hi, I’m Captain Hennessey, creator of Civpy.</p>

<p>Civpy is a civilization game, written in Python. It’s going to have a 
flashier name but Civpy will do for now.</p>

<p>I’m also keeping it open source for now, to see where it goes.</p>

<p>Above you see two images. The first is a randomly generated world with 
a tiny house. This is the initial state of each Civpy game.</p>

<p>The next image shows the same world, only with the house evolved into a 
small village.</p>

<p>This is what I want to make: a civ game on an expansive map that’s very 
detailed at the same time. Cities aren’t just one tile (as was the case 
in the old Civilization franchise) but are a collection of buildings.</p>

<p>Each tile represents about the same size as a SimCity tile, which is 
around 1 acre. (So yes, if I want a map to represent an entire planet, 
we’ll need around 1m x 1m tiles—let’s park that thought for now)</p>

<p>The map is generated by a randomized algorithm. First it generates an 
altitude map, based on which other maps are generated (temperature, 
biomass, etc.)</p>

<p>The idea is that humans naturally start spreading around, but that the 
rate of spreading is limited by the surroundings: if there’s not enough 
biomass or arable land around, the population capacity per tile is capped. 
Also, “wilderness” is a factor: if you live on the edge of town, you’re 
more exposed to bad elements like wolves, barbarians etc.</p>

<p>OK, now some background about me and my motivation to make this game.</p>

<p>As we all know, game design involves a lot of hard choices, cursing and 
drinking. To make things worse, I’m not a good programmer.</p>

<p>Choice #1: Python.</p>

<p>Python is a little slow but there’s a lot of useful modules available such 
as Cocos2d. So basically all of the graphics and interface handling are 
done by Cocos2d. Later I will try to employ Cython to speed up the game, 
as well as directly use OpenGL to specifically speed up the graphics (it’s 
painfully slow on big maps and a reason why I can’t go beyond 64x64 
currently).</p>

<p>Choice #2: Graphics.</p>

<p>The tiles are 16x16 pixels. Yes that resolution hasn’t been fashionable 
since the late ‘80s but it speeds up art development significantly. The 
trick is to make each pixel count.</p>

<p>Choice #3: No visible actors.</p>

<p>Most of the game state is stored in a bunch of two-dimensional arrays. You 
won’t see tiny figures running around (at least not for now). I figured it 
was going to take a lot of effort modeling individual characters (peasants, 
lumberjacks, smiths whatever) as they go about their business. Instead I 
chose for a SimCity-like approach, where (for example) population in one 
tile depends on the amount of food in the surrounding tiles.</p>

<p>Choice #4: No AI.</p>

<p>Maybe later :)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope to update as much as possible!</p>
