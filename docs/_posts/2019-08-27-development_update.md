title: Development Update 
---

After last week's alpha demo release, I've started 
implementing some new features:

- Cursor: you can now see what you're building, and 
whether it's possible to build, using the cursor.

- Message panel: any important messages will appear 
in the message panel at the bottom of the screen. 
For now, it's mostly warnings and welcome messages.

Here's a video of the latest development build containing these features:
