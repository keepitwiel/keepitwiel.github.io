Anno Romuli 0. Your world is empty, save for the asterisk shaped 
tile which is your Settlement. It will start emanating Culture 
which in turn allows the population surrounding your settlement 
to grow over time. The white-on-pink Omega symbol indicates the 
cursor.

We pressed Enter a few times to let the city populate itself. The 
faces in the top middle indicate the population under the cursor 
(here highlighted by the white letter 'F' - which will build a 
Farm on that tile when pressed). Note we built quite a few farms 
around the settlement. The pink house-shaped symbol indicates 
people are living there.

A civilization is born! We also built a Logger (Omega symbol) to 
produce wood, and Walls (stripy white blocks) to protect our city. 
There's a lot of wood currently under the cursor, indicated by the 
green Ws in the top middle.
