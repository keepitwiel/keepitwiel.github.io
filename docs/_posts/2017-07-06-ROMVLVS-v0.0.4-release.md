title: ROMVLVS v0.0.4 release
---

After a hiatus of almost 2 years, I picked up the slack and made 
some long-needed updates and fixes.

The game can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ij5XNUwo0A5GtjUbetVDTnXojj_90VWN

## Notable changes:
- Game doesn’t break when you hit an unrecognized key
- Changed appearance (10x10 pixel tiles were very tiny)
- Changed game engine - added “culture” layer which is generated 
by humans and allows for spreading of your civilization, up to a 
point

## How to install:
Please see previous post on how to run it (basically, extract 
contents of .zip archive, then double click the “run” file - 
execute directly or from terminal is fine)

It’s still for Linux only (specifically, it was developed and 
tested in Lubuntu 16.04 at 2880x1800 pixels)

You might have to move your cursor around to find the piece of 
land that’s visible to you.

Hope you like it - and please send me feedback if you have any!
