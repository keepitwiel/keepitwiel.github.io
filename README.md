If you enjoy pain, look at pages.github.com on how to install Ruby/Jekyll and generate the HTML site from markdown files.

You will probably only need to do this once to generate a Gemfile.

Once you push to origin, Github takes care of the publishing.

Folder structure:

    /docs

Root folder (make sure to set this as root folder in the repo settings on Github)

    /docs/_posts

Folder with all blog posts (markdown files)
